Resources for those interested in teaching and researching with digital technologies

Want to continue the conversations from #CWCon? There are several options I want to make sure everyone is aware of. 

- Sign up for the TechRhet discussion group by visiting https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/techrhet/join. You will receive a confirmation message. Please follow the instructions in that message to finalize your list membership. Traci Gardner (tengrrl) is the list manager. The list is open to all colleagues, but those who undertake acts of digital aggression will be removed.
- Join the Technorhetorician Working Group on Facebook by visiting https://www.facebook.com/groups/875372475941498/.
- Follow the work of the 7Cs (The CCCC Committee on Computers in Composition and Communication, which is 8 Cs, but we don't worry about that) on the website at https://www.ncte.org/cccc/committees/7cs, and on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/7CsCommittee/.
- Continue to tag your tweets with the hashtag #CWCON on Twitter. 

Please share this information with interested graduate students, contingent faculty, tenure-track faculty, alt-ac professionals, and other interested colleagues. We want to continue welcoming people to the fold and invite everyone to participate in the on-going conversations. 

Even if you did not attend Computers and Writing this year, please join us in talking about how we work with digital technology in the classroom, in our research, and in our professional lives (and elsewhere!). 

If you have any questions that I can help with, feel free to contact Traci Gardner directly at @tengrrl or tengrrl@tengrrl.com/

P.S. I promise to make this prettier once I'm back home! â€”Traci
